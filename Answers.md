1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

`Client-side routing loads all components and renders them based on the current URL, which means changing pages within an application is faster because it doesn't require any requests to a server. Server side routing is the opposite, where a request is made every time the url changes. The initial load time for server-side routing is faster because it doesn't require a download of all app data.`
